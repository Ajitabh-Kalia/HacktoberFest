Explanation:

Notification Interface: Defines the common behavior (sendNotification) for all notifications.

Concrete Notification Classes: Each notification type (Email, SMS, Push) has its own class that implements the sendNotification method with specific logic.

Notification Factory: The factory method (createNotification) is responsible for creating the appropriate notification object based on the input.

Client Code: The Main class demonstrates how the client interacts with the factory to get the notification type and send the message without worrying about the object creation details.
